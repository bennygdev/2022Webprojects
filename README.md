# 2022 December Web Projects
This is a work in progress. I wanted to put all my small projects written in JavaScript created over the holidays and put it here. Then I will make a webpage that links to all the small projects. Still a work in progress and hopefully to push before my next school term starts.

# Description
I've decided to work on a project for each day and share my thoughts with it. For each day I am going to spend my time making a new project that shows the use of JavaScript in projects.

# To-do List web app
To do list is where you can put your daily tasks there. This includes a local storage function, where it essentially stores your tasks on your browser so that It will not get wiped out when you refresh or close the browser. It includes 3 categories where you can rank a task according to how important it is, with urgent being the most important. Currently, this is only suitable for desktop and tablet viewing.

I learnt some of the code from a tutorial and recreated it by scratch. I enjoyed learning how localstorage works and more and more ideas popped up in my head after learning more about it. This does not use any CSS framework for now, as I wanted to reduce how much HTML is being used to style the web app. Overall, this was a fun side project to do. More detailed README about the to do list can be found here(link later)
