# Tic Tac Toe
Tic Tac Toe is a web game used to play tic tac toe. I've made a tic tac toe game to practice more of my javascript knowledge. Note that this is a primitive version of the tic tac toe game and do not expect it to run perfectly, if there are any errors please do let me know. This game has multiple functions, there is a score tracker wrapper just right below the header, where it tracks what player's turns and the scores for player 1 and 2. Below is the board, where you basically just play tic tac toe. When one of the players win, a green text will show right below the board showing who won. There is a restart button to restart the game, if a player has won before, that player gets to start first next game when the game is restarted. The reset button will reset board and along with the scores. Finally, there is a light and dark theme button at the bottom right. This does not use any CSS framework, and this web app is suitable for all Desktop, Tablet and Mobile viewing.

# How to use

2. When the game ends, you can proceed to just restart the game, the next game will let the winner start first and the score will be saved.

3. If you had enough of playing the game, you can go ahead and reset the game. This will wipe out the scores and reset the default starting player to X.
