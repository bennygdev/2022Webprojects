# To-do List
To-do List is a web appp written in JavaScript where you can put your daily tasks there. This includes a local storage function, where it essentially stores your tasks on your browser so that It will not get wiped out when you refresh or close the browser. It includes 3 categories where you can rank a task according to how important it is, with urgent being the most important. Currently, this is only suitable for desktop and tablet viewing.

# Conclusion

I learnt some of the code from a tutorial and recreated it by scratch. I enjoyed learning how localstorage works and more and more ideas popped up in my head after learning more about it. This does not use any CSS framework for now, as I wanted to reduce how much HTML is being used to style the web app. Overall, this was a fun side project to do.
