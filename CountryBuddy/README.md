# Country Buddy
Country buddy is a web app where it uses the REST countries API to allow users to look up country information with just a search. The REST countries api can be found at https://restcountries.com/ and used it to display the country's information. This is my first time using an API like this and how this REST countries API work is by accessing the object and extracting certain values from an array. I decided to not use any CSS framework for this as I wanted the functionality from the JavaScript to stand out. This is available for desktop, tablet and mobile view (I put in so much code for CSS).

You can go ahead and search any countries by just entering your desired country name and looking up the country information. Note that if you enter any invalid country or leave it blank, it will display an error.

# Conclusion
I read the API and explored on how to read an array from an object in JavaScript. I then printed the object to the console and read most of the keys and values and managed to extract the values from the object. I learnt how APIs can be used to make complex functionality more easily and ultimately, it saves you alot of time for example having to manually add countries, to adding cooking recipes. It was fun using an API that does wonders so easily and could be handy for future projects.
